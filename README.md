## Introduction
**4Focus** is a simple tool aimed to increase focus by reducing distractions, with the goal to provide maximum user-friendliness by providing a simple but efficient surface to interact with. 

This allows for more directed focus while working or studying, or removing visual clutter when watching movies or videos, while still allowing for fast and flexible use of all available monitors.


## So What Does It Do
**4Focus** opens up black windows covering every connected monitor. You can bring the windows you need back into focus for example by using alt-tab or the windows-key to show the taskbar, and freely move them around and over the black background. Simple in essence, but very effective.

There are several hotkeys in place to enhance the user experience:


| key | function |
|-|-|
| escape | to exit the program |
| m | to minimize all windows |
| space | to maximize all windows |
| down | to minimize only the current window |


These allow for fast and flexible window management, and allow for example an easy "hard reset" when the visual clutter starts taking over again, and much more with the click of a single button.

To use the hotkeys, simply bring any of the windows into focus (alt-tab, clicking on one, etc.) and pressing the desired button.


## How to Install

Simply download `4Focus.exe` from the _Releases_ section, and you're good to go! No installation required, not even Python.

The first time running the `.exe` file you might get a warning saying that the app isn't recognized, but after clicking 'More Info' and 'Run anyway' the warning shouldn't pop up anymore.

The only way to get rid of the warning would require me to buy a yearly subscription costing hundreds of euros, and since this is free, open-source software, that isn't in the cards for now.

Alternatively, if you prefer to use Python to run the program instead, clone the repository and run main.py using a Python environment containing the packages listed in requirements.txt, which can simply be installed by running:

```batch
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
